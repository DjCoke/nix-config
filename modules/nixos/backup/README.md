# Backup

See [this repo](https://github.com/SterlingHooten/borg-backup-exclusions-macos) for where the backup
exclude lists originated from.

## Exclude Lists

Exclude lists are purposefully kept in external files so that it's easier to integrate additions based on other repos.

NOTE: Folders containing a .nobackup file will not be backed up!
